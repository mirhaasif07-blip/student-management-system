Student Management System

This project is a Student Management System built using PHP and MySQL, designed to simplify the management of student records in educational institutions such as schools, colleges, or training centers.  

The system allows administrators to **store, update, and track student information** efficiently, while maintaining a log of all actions for accountability. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of **database management, CRUD operations, and web development with PHP**.  

 Purpose:

Managing student data manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This system provides a **centralized and organized solution** to keep track of students' personal and academic details while ensuring data integrity through proper logging.  

 Core Functionalities:

- Create: Add new student records with details like Name, Email, Phone, City, Gender, Course, and Age.  
- Read: View all student records in a structured tabular format.  
- Update: Modify existing student information when needed.  
- Delete: Remove student records securely.  
- Reset: Clear all data and logs to start fresh, useful for demo or testing purposes.  
- Activity Logging: Automatically logs every action (Insert, Update, Delete) with timestamps to ensure traceability.  

This project serves as a practical example of hhow web applications interact with databases and can be extended or customized for more complex student management requirements in the future.
